# Agent Detection Overview

Superline Agent Detection provides real-time detection of AI agents in browser sessions using metadata and behavioral patterns. This page provides an overview of how the library works and its key components.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature Extraction">
    The library extracts features from browser metadata and user behavior (mouse movements, keyboard patterns, scroll behavior, clicks)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Processing">
    Extracted features are processed through standardization, normalization, and one-hot encoding where appropriate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Scoring">
    A logistic regression model analyzes the processed features to calculate a detection probability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classification">
    The probability value is compared to a threshold to classify the session as human or AI agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Detector" icon="magnifying-glass">
    The core component that manages the detection process, including initialization, data collection, and result generation. This is your main point of interaction with the library.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example of creating and using the Agent Detector
    AgentDetector.init({ debug: false, autoStart: true });
    const result = await AgentDetector.finalizeDetection();
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feature Extractors" icon="filter">
    Components that collect and analyze different aspects of the browser session. The library includes extractors for browser metadata, mouse events, keyboard events, scroll events, and click events.
    
    Each extractor focuses on a specific aspect of user behavior and contributes specific features to the detection model.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Detection Model" icon="brain">
    A logistic regression model that processes the extracted features to calculate a confidence. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled browser sessions from both humans and AI agents.
    
    The model parameters (weights and intercepts/bias) are included in the library, making it work "out of the box" without requiring server-side processing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment System" icon="server">
    A pluggable system that adapts the library to different operational contexts. The default browser environment provides real-time event collection, while a replay environment is available for offline analysis.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Storage System" icon="database">
    A system for persisting events and metadata during the detection process. The default implementation uses IndexedDB in browser environments to ensure data is available across page loads.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Detection Result

When you call `AgentDetector.finalizeDetection()` or `AgentDetector.getCurrentDetectionResult()`, you receive a detection result with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  isAgent: boolean,     // True if the session is classified as an AI agent
  confidence: number,   // Probability prediction between 0 and 1
  features?: any        // Preprocessed features used for scoring (optional)
}
```
