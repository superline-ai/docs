## What is Superline Agent Detection?

Superline Agent Detection is a lightweight, high-performance library for detecting AI agents in real-time from browser sessions based on browser environment metadata and behavioral patterns.

The library extracts features from browser metadata and behavioral data (mouse movements, keyboard patterns, scroll behavior, clicks) and processes them through a logistic regression model to calculate detection probability.
